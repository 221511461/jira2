# Sometimes Node.js requires intermediate certificates for some authorities, which means SSL won't work out-of-the-box

# If you think you have fixed the issue, please write a script to make sure you are not breaking prod servers from GitHubServerApps
# and run within the app using e.g. anonymous client. Those servers that were not returning SSL errors (e.g. when using "fetch()") shouldn't
